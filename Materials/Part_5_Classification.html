# Measuring Performance in Classification

# Illustrative Example  &lt;img src="images/yardstick.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

`yardstick` contains another test set example in a data frame called `two_class_example`:



```r
library(yardstick)
library(dplyr)
two_class_example %&gt;% head(4)
```

```
##    truth  Class1 Class2 predicted
## 1 Class2 0.00359  0.996    Class2
## 2 Class1 0.67862  0.321    Class1
## 3 Class2 0.11089  0.889    Class2
## 4 Class1 0.73516  0.265    Class1
```

Both `truth` and `predicted` are factors with the same levels. The other two columns represent _class probabilities_. 

This reflects that most classification models can generate "hard" and "soft" predictions for models. 

The class predictions are usually created by thresholding some numeric output of the model (e.g. a class probability) or by choosing the largest value.  



---

# Class Prediction Metrics

.pull-left[
With class predictions, a common summary method is to produce a _confusion matrix_ which is a simple cross-tabulation between the observed and predicted classes:


```r
two_class_example %&gt;% 
	conf_mat(truth = truth, estimate = predicted)
```

```
##           Truth
## Prediction Class1 Class2
##     Class1    227     50
##     Class2     31    192
```

These can be visualized using [mosaic plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_plot). 

]
.pull-right[
Accuracy is the most obvious metric for characterizing the performance of models.


```r
two_class_example %&gt;% 
	accuracy(truth = truth, estimate = predicted)
```

```
## [1] 0.838
```

However, it suffers when there is a _class imbalance_; suppose 95% of the data have a specific class. 95% accuracy can be achieved by predicting samples to be the majority class.  

There are measures that correct for the natural event rate, such as [Cohen's Kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa).
]

# Two Classes


There are a number of specialized metrics that can be used when there are two classes. Usually, one of these classes can be considered the _event of interest_ or the _positive class_. 

One common way to think about performance is to consider false negatives and false positives. 

* the sensitivity is the _true positive rate_

* the specificity is the rate of correctly predicted negatives, or 1 - _false positive rate_. 

From this, assuming that `Class1` is the event of interest: 

 .pull-left[

```
##           Truth
## Prediction Class1 Class2
##     Class1    227     50
##     Class2     31    192
```
]
.pull-right[
 sensitivity = 227/(227 + 31)  = 0.88

 specificity = 192/(192 + 50)  = 0.79
]


---

# Conditional and Unconditional Measures

Sensitivity and specificity can be computed from the `sens` and `spec` functions, respectively. 

It should be noted that these are _conditional measures_ since we need to know the true outcome. 

The event rate is the _prevalence_ (or the Bayesian _prior_). Sensitivity and specificity analogous to the _likelihood values_. 

There are _unconditional_ analogs to the _posterior values_ called the positive predictive values and the negative predicted values. 

A variety of other measures are available for two class systems, especially for _information retrieval_.  

One thing to consider: what happens if our **threshold to call a sample an event is not optimal**? 


---

# Changing the Probability Threshold

.pull-left[
For two classes, the 50% cutoff is customary; if the probability of class #1 is &gt;= 50%, they would be labelled as `Class1`. 


What happens when you change the cutoff? 

* Increasing it makes it harder to be called `Class1` `\(\Rightarrow\)` fewer predicted events, specificity `\(\uparrow\)`, sensitivity `\(\downarrow\)` 
  

* Decreasing the cutoff makes it easier to be called `Class1` `\(\Rightarrow\)` more predicted events, specificity `\(\downarrow\)`, sensitivity `\(\uparrow\)`  

With two classes, the **Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve** can be used to estimate performance using a combination of sensitivity and specificity.  

]
.pull-right[
  
To create the curve, many alternative cutoffs are evaluated. 

For each cutoff, we calculate the sensitivity and specificity.

The ROC curve plots the sensitivity (eg. true positive rate) versus 1 - specificity (eg. the false positive rate).
  
The area under the ROC curve is a common metric of performance.  
]

# The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve 

.pull-left[

```r
library(pROC)
roc_obj &lt;- roc(
	response = two_class_example$truth,
	predictor = two_class_example$Class1,
	# If the first level is the event of interest:
	levels = rev(levels(two_class_example$truth))
	)
```

```r
auc(roc_obj)
```

```
## Area under the curve: 0.939
```

```r
plot(
	roc_obj,
	legacy.axes = TRUE,
	print.thres = c(.2, .5, .8), 
	print.thres.pattern = "cut = %.2f (Sp = %.3f, Sn = %.3f)",
	print.thres.cex = .8
)
```

]

  
---

# The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve 

The ROC curve has some major advantages:

 * It can allow models to be optimized for performance before a definitive cutoff is determined.
 
 * It is _robust_ to class imbalances; no matter the event rate, it does a good job at characterizing model performance. 
 
 * The ROC curve can be used to pick an optimal cutoff based on the trade-offs between the types of errors that can occur. 

When there are two classes, it is advisable to focus on the area under the ROC curve instead of sensitivity and specificity. 

Once an acceptable model is determined, a proper cutoff can be determined.

# OkC Data

.pull-left[
These data contains several types of fields:

* a number of open text essays related to interests and personal descriptions 
* single choice type fields, such as profession, diet, gender, body type, etc.
* multiple choice data, including languages spoken, etc.

We will try to predict whether someone has a profession in the STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math) using a random sample of the overall dataset. 

The data are included in the workshop's GitHub repo:

# Dealing with Class Imbalances

In our data, only 18.2% of the profiles are in STEM professions. This complicates the analysis since many models will overfit to the majority class.

There are two main strategies to deal with this:

 * _Cost-sensitive learning_ where a higher cost is attached to the minority classes. In this way, the fitting process puts more emphasis on those samples. 
 
 * _Sampling procedures_ that modify the rows of the data to re-balance the training set. 
 
Cost-sensitive models tend to only produce hard classifications so we will focus on the latter. 


---

# Class Imbalance Sampling

There are a variety of methods for subsampling the data. Some exclude or replicate rows in the training set while others try to _synthesize_ new data points to balance the classes. 

The simplest method for dealing with the problem is to _down-sample_ the data to make the number of STEM and non-STEM profiles the same. 

While it seems like throwing away most of the data is a bad idea, it tends top produce less pathological distributions of the class probabilities and _might_ improve the ROC curve. 


It is critical that:

 * the sampling should be done _inside of resampling_. Otherwise, the [performance estimates can be optimistic](https://topepo.github.io/caret/subsampling-for-class-imbalances.html#resampling). 
 * these sampling methods take place on the analysis set and not the assessment set

Note that for a simple logistic regression model, this mainly has the effect of changing the intercept.

# Resampling and Analysis Strategy

.pull-left[
If we down-sample the data, the analysis set will consist of 1458 profiles (equally balanced). We'll again use 10-fold CV to resample the data. 

Within each resample, the analysis data are down-sampled and the assessment sets are left alone.


The number of STEM profiles held-out would be about 72 and this should be sufficient to compute sensitivity.  
]

The models will be optimized on the area under the ROC curve.

	method = "cv",
	# Also predict the probabilities
	classProbs = TRUE,
	# Compute the ROC AUC as well as the sens and  
	# spec from the default 50% cutoff. The 
	# function `twoClassSummary` will produce those. 
	summaryFunction = twoClassSummary,
	savePredictions = "final",
	sampling = "down"

# Classification Trees

# Classification Trees

Tree-based classifiers conduct searches of the predictors to find the best split of the data to create two subsets. 

"Best", in most cases, means that the class distribution is as _pure_ as possible in the subsets (i.e. is mostly one class). 

There are many different types of classification trees, including [conditional inference trees](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/party/index.html), [C5.0](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/C50/index.html), [Bayesian additive regression trees](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BayesTree/index.html), [globally optimal trees](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/evtree/index.html), [CART](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html), and others. 

We'll focus on CART via the `rpart` package for these notes.

# The Next Two splits

.pull-left[
Once the initial split is made, the model will then split the resulting two data sets using new searches in those _leaves_. 

The process continues until there are not enough data points left to accurately split or a pre-defined split limit has been reached.  

This is the _tree growing_ process and, once complete, most tree-based models begin to _prune_ the trees using some method that balances complexity with performance.

CART tracks the decrease in impurity in the nodes when splits are made. 

These can be aggregated over the tree to produce another general importance score. 

`rpart` can also keep track of splits not used in the model (e.g. surrogate, completing) that can be used when there are missing predictor values. The `varImp` method has options to turn these on/off. 

Turning these off gives only the splits uses in the official tree.

# Bagging (Again)

# Instability of Trees

Many types of trees are _unstable_ in that they have high variance; if the data are slightly changed, a large impact can be seen on the structure of the model. 

This is generally bad and might make you question the interpretability of trees. 

For example, what happens if we were to build our model on bootstrap samples of the training set?

In the three following plots, the maximum tree depth was capped at 5 to make the trees easier to visualize.

# Bootstrap Sample #1

&lt;img src="Part_5_Classification_files/figure-html/boot-cart-1-1.svg" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

# Lemonade from Lemons

The _nice_ thing about this instability is that it makes trees great candidates for ensemble methods. 

Since ensembles use multiple models, they are only effective when the constituent models are _diverse_; otherwise the same predictions are averaged. 

Let's bag the CART trees by using bootstrap samples of the training set and growing the largest possible tree. 

`caret` wraps `ipred::bagging` using `method = "treebag"`.

Look at the help function to determine which `bagging` argument controls the number of bootstraps.

How can we make `train` use a different value? (hint: `?train`)

Does changing this affect the area under the ROC curve? 

Take another 10 mins.

# Other Ensemble Methods

There are a variety of other methods for creating ensembles

* **Random forests** are just like bagging but the trees are made more diverse by randomly sampling a subset of predictors to be used in each split. ([`ranger`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ranger/index.html))

* **Boosting** fits a _sequence_ of trees and modifies the case-weights of each data point to increase diversity. ([`xgboost`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xgboost/index.html), [`C50`](https://topepo.github.io/C5.0/))

* **Rotation forests** is PCA signal extraction on random subset of the data prior to creating the trees. ([`rotationForest`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rotationForest/index.html))

* Regression **committees** adjust the outcome data over a sequence of models. ([`Cubist`](https://topepo.github.io/Cubist/)) 

* **Stacking** is an ensemble method where different types of models can be blended together through averaging. ([`caretEnsemble`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/caretEnsemble/index.html))

R has multiple implmentations of these methods.

#  Bayes' Rule


---

# Naive Bayes Models

This classification model is motivated directly from statistical theory based on Bayes' Rule:

`$$Pr[Class|Predictors] = \frac{Pr[Class]\times Pr[Predictors|Class]}{Pr[Predictors]} 
= \frac{Prior\:\times\:Likelihood}{Evidence}$$`

In English:

&gt; Given our predictor data, what is the probability of each class? 

The _prior_ is the prevalence that was mentioned earlier (e.g. the rate of STEM profiles). This can be estimated or set. 

Most of the action is in `Pr[Predictors|Class]`, which is based on the observed training set.

Predictions are based on a blend of the traning data and our _prior belief_ about the outcome... 



---

# So  Why is it Naive?

Determining `\(Pr[Predictors|Class]\)` can be very difficult without strong assumptions because it measures the _joint probability_ of all of the predictors. 

* For example, what is the correlation between a person's essay length and their religion? 

To resolve this, **naive** Bayes assumes that all of the predictors are _independent_ and that their probabilities can be estimated separately. 

The joint probability is then the product of all of the individual probabilities (an example follows soon). 

This assumption is almost certainly bogus but the model tends to do well despite this. 


---

# The Effect of Independence

The probability contours assume multivariate normality with different assumptions.  

Suppose the red dot is a new sample.

&lt;img src="Part_5_Classification_files/figure-html/nb-cat-1.svg" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

# Combining Predictor Scores with the Prior




For an Atheist who wrote _e_&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; words, their likelihood values were:

* `\(Pr[Essay\: Length = 8|STEM] \times Pr[Religion=Atheism|STEM]\)` = 0.518 x 0.207 = 0.107

* `\(Pr[Essay\: Length = 8|Other] \times Pr[Religion=Atheism|Other]\)` =0.428 x 0.103 = 0.044

However, when these are combined with the _prior probability_ for each class, the _relative probabilities_ show:


* `\(Pr[Predictors|STEM] \times Pr[STEM]\)` = 0.107 x 0.182 = 0.02

* `\(Pr[Predictors|Other] \times Pr[Other]\)` = 0.044 x 0.818 = 0.036

We don't need to compute the evidence; we can just normalize these values to add up to 1. 

The results is that the _posterior probability_ that this person is in a STEM field is 35.1%.

# "Shrinkage" Properties of Bayesian Models

.pull-left[
When our observed data is of high quality (top panel), the likelihood is narrow and dominates the equation.  

However, when our observed information is poor, the likelihood can be very wide and diffuse. 

When this occurs, Bayes' rule relies more on our prior belief than on the data in-hand. 

This is generally called "shrinkage".

# Pros and Cons

.pull-left[
Good: 

* This model can be very quickly trained (and theoretically in parallel). 

* Once trained, the prediction is basically a look-up table (i.e. fast). 

* Nonlinear class boundaries can be generated. 

]
.pull-right[
Bad:

* Linearly diagonal boundaries can be difficult.

* With many predictors, the class probabilities become poorly calibrated and U shaped with most values near zero or one. For example:


```r
prod(rep(.1, 100))
```

```
## [1] 1e-100
```

```r
prod(rep(.5, 100))
```

```
## [1] 7.89e-31
```

# Naive Bayes Data Preparations

There is a step specifically designed for converting binary dummy variables into factors. 

First, we identify them, then use quasiquotation (via `!!!`) to pass them to the step function.



```r
library(recipes)
is_dummy &lt;- vapply(okc_train, function(x) length(unique(x)) == 2 &amp; is.numeric(x), logical(1))
dummies &lt;- names(is_dummy)[is_dummy]
no_dummies &lt;- recipe(Class ~ ., data = okc_train) %&gt;%
	step_bin2factor(!!! dummies) %&gt;%
	step_zv(all_predictors())
```

We can also modulate the smoothness of the density estimation for the continuous predictors using the `adjust` option to the `density` function. 



```r
smoothing_grid &lt;- expand.grid(usekernel = TRUE, fL = 0, adjust = seq(0.5, 3.5, by = 0.5))
```

???
ggplot(okc_train, aes(x = essay_length)) + 
   geom_line(stat = "density", adjust = 3) + 
  geom_line(stat = "density", adjust = .3, col = "red")
  
ggplot(okc_train, aes(x = science)) + 
   geom_line(stat = "density") 
   
   
---

# Naive Bayes Training


```r
set.seed(5515)
nb_mod &lt;- train(
	no_dummies,
	data = okc_train,
	method = "nb",
	metric = "ROC",
	tuneGrid = smoothing_grid,
	trControl = ctrl
)
```

Some warnings: `## Warning in FUN(X[[i]], ...): Numerical 0 probability for all classes with observation 1`

This is due to the poorly calibrated probabilities although the warning is a bit misleading. This issue does not generally affect performance and can be ignored.
