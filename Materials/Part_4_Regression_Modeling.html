# Expanded Car MPG Data  &lt;img src="images/dplyr.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

The data that are used here are an extended version of the ubiquitous `mtcars` data set. 

[`fueleconomy.gov`](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml) was used to obtain fuel efficiency data on cars from 2015-2018. 

Over this time range, duplicate ratings were eliminated; these occur when the same car is sold for several years in a row. As a result, there are 3294 cars that are listed in the data. The predictors include the automaker and addition information about the cars (e.g. intake valves per cycle, aspiration method, etc). 

In our analysis, the data from 2015-2107 are used for training to see if we can predict the 609 cars that were new in 2018. 


```r
load("Data/car_data.RData")
library(dplyr)
car_train &lt;- car_data %&gt;%
  filter(model_year &lt; 2018)

car_test &lt;- car_data %&gt;%
  filter(model_year == 2018)
```

# Hands-On: Explore the Car Data

As before, let's take 10 minutes to get familiar with the training set using numerical summaries and plots. 

`geom_smooth` is very helpful here to discover the nature of relationships between the outcome (`mpg`) and the potential predictors. 

???

```
ggplot(car_train, aes(x = eng_displ, y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2))
ggplot(car_train, aes(x = 1/sqrt(eng_displ), y = mpg)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```

layout: false
class: inverse, middle, center

# Linear Models

 
---

# Linear Regression Analysis

We'll start by fitting linear regression models to these data. 

As a reminder, the "linear" part means that the model is linear in the _parameters_; we can add nonlinear terms to the model (e.g. `x^2` or `log(x)`) without causing issues. 

We could start by using `lm` and the formula method using what we've learned so far: 


```r
lm(mpg ~ . -carline + poly(eng_displ, 2), data = car_train)
```


---

# However... &lt;img src="images/dplyr.png" class="title-hex"&gt;


```r
car_train %&gt;%
  group_by(division) %&gt;%
  count() %&gt;%
  arrange(n) %&gt;%
  head(8)
```

```
## # A tibble: 8 x 2
## # Groups: division [8]
##   division                      n
##   &lt;chr&gt;                     &lt;int&gt;
## 1 bugatti                       1
## 2 mclaren_automotive_limted     1
## 3 mobility_ventures_llc         1
## 4 pagani_automobili_s.p.a.      1
## 5 lotus_cars_ltd                2
## 6 mclaren                       2
## 7 alfa_romeo                    5
## 8 genesis                       7
```

If one of these low occurrence car divisions is only in the assessment set, it may cause issues (or errors) in some models.  

A basic recipe will be created to account for this that collapses these data into an "other" category and will create dummy variables. 

The recipe can be augmented when the model requires additional preprocessing.

# Linear Regression Analysis for the Car Data   &lt;img src="images/recipes.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/dplyr.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

With recipes, variables can have different roles, such as case-weights, cluster, censoring indicator, etc. 

We should keep `carline` in the data so that we can use it to diagnose issues but we don't want it as a predictor. 

The role of this variable will be changed to `"car name"`. 



```r
library(recipes)
basic_rec &lt;- recipe(mpg ~ ., data = car_train) %&gt;%
  # keep the car name but don't use as a predictor
  add_role(carline, new_role = "car name") %&gt;%
  # collapse some divisions into "other"
  step_other(division, threshold = 0.005) %&gt;%
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -carline) %&gt;%
  step_zv(all_predictors())
```

```
## Warning: Changing role(s) for carline
```

???

This will results in 80 predictors using the entire training set. 


---

# Potential Issues with Linear Regression

We'll look at the car data and examine a few different models to illustrate some more complex models and approaches to optimizing them. We'll start with linear models. 

However, some potential issues with linear methods:

* They do not automatically do _feature selection_ and including irrelevant predictors may degrade performance.
* Linear models are sensitive to situations where the predictors are _highly correlated_ (aka collinearity). This isn't too big of an issue for these data though. 

To mitigate these two scenarios, _regularization_ will be used.  This approach adds a penalty to the regression parameters. 

 * In order to have a large slope in the model, the predictor will need to have a large impact on the model. 
 
There are different types of regularization methods. 


---

# Effect of Collinearity

As an example of collinearity, the `longley` contains economic data. We can try to predict the number of people employed per year as a function of the population size and the nation's gross domestic product (GDP). 

The issue is that the two predictors have a correlation near 1. 

What happens when we fit models with both predictors versus one-at-a-time? 


&lt;table class="table" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:center; border-bottom:hidden; padding-bottom:0; padding-left:3px;padding-right:3px;" colspan="1"&gt;&lt;div style="border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd; padding-bottom: 5px;"&gt;Term&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt;   &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; GNP &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Population &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Both &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:right;"&gt; Inflation &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; GNP &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.035 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.000 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.063 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 39.0 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; Population &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.000 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 0.485 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; -0.410 &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:right;"&gt; 16.4 &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

The coefficients can drastically change depending on what is in the model.

# Regularized Linear Regression

Now suppose we want to see if _regularizing_ the regression coefficients will result in better fits. 

The [`glmnet` model](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v033i01) can be used to build a linear model using L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; or L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regularization (or a mixture of the two). 

 * an L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; penalty (penalty is `\(\lambda_1\sum|\beta_j|\)`) can have the effect of setting coefficients to zero. 
 * L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; regularization ( `\(\lambda_2\sum\beta_j^2\)` ) is basically ridge regression where the magnitude of the coefficients are dampened to avoid overfitting

For a `glmnet` model, we need to determine the total amount regularization (called `lambda`) and the mixture of L&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and L&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (called `alpha`). 

* `alpha` = 1  is a _lasso model_ while `alpha` = 0  is _ridge regression_ (aka weight decay).

The predictors require centering and scaling before being used in a `glmnet`, lasso, or ridge regression model. 

Technical bits can be found in [Statistical Learning with Sparsity](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/StatLearnSparsity/).

???

Note the need to center and scale based on the type of penalty

---

# Tuning the `glmnet` Model

We have two tuning parameters now (`alpha` and `lambda`). We can extend our previous grid search approach by creating a 2D grid of parameters to test.  

* `alpha` must be between zero and one. A small grid is used for this parameter.  
* `lambda` is not as clear-cut. We consider values on the log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; scale. Usually values less than one are sufficient but this is not always true. 

We can create combinations of these parameters and store them in a data frame:


```r
glmn_grid &lt;- expand.grid(alpha = seq(0, 1, by = .25), lambda = 10^seq(-3, -1, length = 20))
nrow(glmn_grid)
```

```
## [1] 100
```

Instead of using `rsample` to tune the model, the `train` function in the `caret` package will be introduced. 


---

# `caret`

[`caret`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/caret/index.html) was developed to:

* create a unified interface for modeling and prediction to 238 models
* streamline model tuning using resampling
* provide a variety of "helper" functions and classes for day-to-day model building tasks 
* increase computational efficiency using parallel processing 
* enable several feature selection frameworks

It was originally developed in 2005 and is still very active. 

There is an extensive [`github.io`](https://topepo.github.io/caret/) page and an [article in JSS](http://www.jstatsoft.org/v28/i05/paper). 


---

# `caret` Basics

.pull-left[

`train` can take a formula method, a recipe object, or a non-formula approach (`x`/`y`) to specify the model. 


```r
train(recipe, data = dataset)
# or 
train(y ~ ., data = dataset)
# or
train(x = predictors, y = outcome)
```

Another argument, `method`, is used to specify the type of model to fit. 

This is _usually_ named after the fitting function. 
]
.pull-right[


We will need to use `method = "glmnet"` for that model. [`?models`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/caret/versions/6.0-78/topics/train_model_list) has a list of all possibilities.  

_One way_ of listing the submodels that should be evaluated is to used the `tuneGrid` parameter:


```r
train(recipe, 
      data = car_train, 
      method = "glmnet",
      tuneGrid = glmn_grid)
```

Alternatively, the `tuneLength` argument will let `train` determine a grid sequence for each parameter.

# The Resampling Scheme

How much (and how) should we resample these data to create the model?

Previously, cross-validation was discussed. If 10-fold CV was used, the assessment set would consist of about 268 cars (on average). 

That seems like an acceptable amount of data to determine the RMSE for each submodel. 

`train` has a control function that can be used to define parameters related to the numerical aspects of the search: 



```r
library(caret)
ctrl &lt;- trainControl(
  method = "cv", 
  # Save the assessment predictions from the best model
  savePredictions = "final",
  # Log the progress of the tuning process
  verboseIter = TRUE
  )
```

???
There are ways to translate `rsample` resample indices to `caret` and vice-versa. 


---

# Fitting the Model via `caret::train` &lt;img src="images/recipes.png" class="title-hex"&gt; 

Let's add some nonlinearity and centering/scaling to the preprocessing and run the search: 


```r
glmn_rec &lt;- basic_rec %&gt;%
  step_poly(eng_displ) %&gt;%
  step_center(all_predictors()) %&gt;%
  step_scale(all_predictors())

set.seed(3544)
glmn_mod &lt;- train(
  glmn_rec, 
  data = car_train,
  method = "glmnet", 
  trControl = ctrl,
  tuneGrid = glmn_grid
  )
```

# Aside: Submodel Trick

Our grid contained 5 values for `alpha` and 20 values of `lambda`. 

Although it might seem like we are fitting 100 models _per_ resample, we are not. 

For many models, including `glmnet`, there are some computational shortcuts that can be used. 

In this case, for a fixed value of `alpha`, the `glmnet` model computes the results for all possible values of `lambda`. Predictions from any of these models can be obtained from the same object. 

This means that we only need to fit 5 models per resample. 

Trees and other models can often exploit this _submodel trick_ and `caret` automatically does this whenever possible.

These points are averages of 10 resamples as before. 

On the whole training set, the recipe gives us 80 predictors and this model only used 81 or 101.2%.

A more general approach of computing "variable importance" scores can be useful for assessing which predictors are driving the model. These are model-specific. 

For this model, we can plot the absolute values of the coefficients. 

This is another good reason to center and scale the predictors before the model.

# Notes on `train`

* Setting the seed just before calling `train` will ensure that the same resamples are used between models. There is also a [help page on reproducibility](https://topepo.github.io/caret/model-training-and-tuning.html#repro).

* `train` calls the underlying model (e.g. `glmnet`) and arguments can be passed to the lower level functions via the `...`

* You can write your own model code (or examine what `train` uses) with the  `getModelInfo` function. 

* If the formula method is used, dummy variables will _always_ be generated for the model. 

* If you don't like the settings that are chosen, the `update` function can be used to change them without repeating all of the resampling.

# Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines

# Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)

MARS is a nonlinear machine learning model that develops sequential sets of artificial features that are used in linear models (similar to the previous spline discussion). 

The features are "hinge functions" or single knot splines that use the function:


```r
h(x) &lt;- function(x) ifelse(x &gt; 0, x, 0)
```

The MARS models does a fast search through every predictor and every value of each predictor to find a suitable "split" point for the predictor that results in the best features. 

Suppose a value `x0` is found. The MARS model creates two model terms `h(x - x0)` and `h(x0 - x)` that are added to the intercept column. This creates a type of _segmented regression_. 

These terms are the same as deep learning rectified linear units ([ReLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectifier_(neural_networks)). 

Let's look at some example data...

---

# MARS Feature Creation -- Iteration #1

.pull-left[
After searching through these data, the model evaluates all possible values of `x0` to find the best "cut" of the data. It finally chooses a value of -0.404. 

To do this, it creates these two new predictors that isolate different regions of `x`. 

If we stop there, these two terms would be added into a linear regression model, yielding:


```
## y =
##   0.111
##   - 0.262 * h(-0.404175 - x)
##   +  2.41 * h(x - -0.404175)
```

# Fitted Model with Two Features

&lt;img src="Part_4_Regression_Modeling_files/figure-html/mars-sim-fit-1.svg" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

# Growing and Pruning

Similar to tree-based models, MARS starts off with a "growing" stage where it keeps adding new features until it reaches a pre-defined limit. 

After the first pair is created, the next cut-point is found using another exhaustive search to see which split of a predictor is best _conditional on the existing features_. 

Once all the features are created, a _pruning phase_ starts where model selection tools are used to eliminate terms that do not contribute meaningfully to the model. 

Generalized cross-validation ([GCV](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C7&amp;q=%22generalized+cross+validation%22&amp;btnG=)) is used to efficiently remove model terms while still providing some protection from overfitting. 


---

#  Generalized Cross-Validation with MARS

For linear models, this is a computational shortcut that can be used to approximate leave-one-out cross-validation. 

GCV can used since MARS is actually fit using ordinary least squares regression. The default MARS approach is to let GCV pick how many terms to retain.  

I usually don't use this methodology. Instead of include the number of retained terms as a tuning parameter and use the usual resampling methods to optimize it. 

In that way, the relationship between the outcome and the number of terms can be better understood. 

Also, I've found that using GCV with MARS increases the likelihood of overfitting (anecdotally).


---

# The Final Model

.pull-left[
For the simulated data, the mars model only requires 4 features to model the data (via GCV).


```
## y =
##   0.0599
##   - 0.126 * h(-0.404175 - x)
##   +  1.61 * h(x - -0.404175)
##   +  2.08 * h(x - -0.222918)
##   -  5.27 * h(x - 0.244406)
```

The parameters are estimated by added the MARS features into ordinary linear regression models using least squares.

# Aspects of MARS Models

* The model also tests to see if a simple linear term is best (i.e. not split). This is also how dummy variables are evaluated. 

* The model automatically conducts _feature selection_; if a predictor is never used in a split, it is functionally independent of the model. This is really good!

* If an additive model is used (as in the previous example), the functional form of each predictor can be determined (and visualized) independently for each predictor. 

* A _second degree_ MARS model also evaluates interactions of two hinge features (e.g. `h(x0 - x) * h(y - y0)`). This can be useful in isolating regions of bivariate predictor space since it divides two-dimensional space into four quadrants.

# MARS in R

The [`mda`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mda) package has a `mars` function but the [`earth`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=earth) package is far superior. 

The [`earth` function](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/earth/versions/4.5.1/topics/earth) has both formula and non-formula interfaces. It can also be used with generalized linear models and flexible discriminant analysis. 

To use the nominal growing and GCV pruning process, the syntax is 


```r
earth(y ~ ., data)

# or 

earth(x = x, y = y)
```

The feature creation process can be controlled using the `nk`, `nprune`, and `pmethod` parameters although this can be [somewhat complex](http://www.milbo.org/doc/earth-notes.pdf). 

There is a variable importance method that tracks the changes in the GCV results as features are added to the model. 


---

# MARS via `caret`

There is a several ways to fit the MARS model using `train`. 

* `method = "earth"` avoids pruning using GCV and uses external resampling to choose the number of retained model terms (using the sub-model trick). The two tuning parameters are `nprune` (number of retained features) and `degree`. 

* `method  = "gcvEarth"` is also available and uses GCV. The `degree` parameter requires tuning. 

I usually use the manual method to better understand the pruning process.

For preprocessing, there is no need to remove zero-variance predictors here (beyond computational efficiency) but dummy variables are required for qualitative predictors. 

Centering and scaling are not required. 


---

# Tuning the Model



We can reuse much of the `glmnet` syntax to tune the model. 


```r
ctrl$verboseIter &lt;- FALSE

mars_grid &lt;- expand.grid(degree = 1:2, nprune = seq(2, 60, by = 2))

# Using the same seed to obtain the same 
# resamples as the glmnet model.
set.seed(3544)
mars_mod &lt;- train(
  basic_rec, 
  data = car_train,
  method = "earth",
  tuneGrid = mars_grid,
  trControl = ctrl
)
```

Running the resampling models (plus the last one), this takes 4.5m on my laptop.

There is no real barrier to running these in parallel. 

Can we benefit from splitting the fits up to run on multiple cores?

These speed-ups can be very model- and data-dependent but this pattern generally holds. 

Note that there is little incremental benefit to using more workers than physical cores on the computer.

# Running in Parallel for `caret`

.pull-left[
To loop through the models and data sets, `caret` uses the [`foreach`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/foreach) package, which can parallelize `for` loops.

`foreach` has a number of _parallel backends_ which allow various technologies to be used in conjunction with the package.

On CRAN, these are the "`do{X}`" packages, such as
[`doAzureParallel`](https://github.com/Azure/doAzureParallel), 
[`doFuture`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/doFuture), [`doMC`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/doMC), 
[`doMPI`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/doMPI), [`doParallel`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/doParallel), [`doRedis`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/doRedis), and [`doSNOW`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/doSNOW).

For example, `doMC` uses the `multicore` package, which forks processes to split computations (for unix and OS X). `doParallel` can be used for all operating systems.
]
.pull-right[
To use parallel processing in `caret`, no changes are needed when calling `train`. 

The parallel technology must be _registered_ with `foreach` prior to calling `train`:

registerDoParallel(cl)

# run `train`...

stopCluster(cl)

# can be helpful:

Recall that as MARS adds or drops terms from the model, the change in the GCV statistic is used to determine the worth of the terms. 

`earth` tracks the changes for each predictor and measures the variable importance based on how much the GCV error _decreases_ when the model term is added. 

This is _cumulative_ when multiple terms involve the same predictor multiple times.

# Ensembles via Bagging

# Bagging Models

[Bagging](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=18412826781870444603&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0,7) is a method of creating _ensembles of the model type_. 

Instead of using the training set, many variations of the data are created that spawn multiple _versions_ of the same model. 

When predicting a new sample, the individual predictions are generated for each model in the ensemble, and these are blended into a single value. This reduces the variation in the predictions since are averaging pseudo-replicates of the model. 

Bagging creates the data sets using a _bootstrap sample_ of the training set. 

Bagging is most useful when the underlying model has some _instability_. This means that slight variations in the data cause significant changes in the model fit. 

For example, simple linear regression would not be a suitable candidate for ensembles but MARS has _potential_ for improvement.  It does have the effect of _smoothing_ the model predictions.

# Collecting and Analyzing the Resampling Results &lt;img src="images/tidyposterior.png" class="title-hex"&gt;


First, we can use the `resamples` function in `caret` to collect and collate the cross-validation results across the different models. 


```r
rs &lt;- resamples(
  list(glmn = glmn_mod, MARS = mars_mod,  bagged = mars_gcv_bag)
)
```

The `tidyposterior` package is designed to estimate the relationship between the _outcome metrics_ (i.e. RMSE) as a function of the model type (i.e. MARS) in a way that takes into account the resample-to-resample covariances that can occur. 

A simple [Bayesian linear model](http://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/articles/continuous.html) is used here for that purpose. 

I recommend the book [_Statistical Rethinking_](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) if you are new to Bayesian analysis. 

Bayes' Rule will be discussed in more detail in the Classification notes to come.

# Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Model &lt;img src="images/tidyposterior.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

If we did a basic ANOVA model to compare models, it might look like:

`$$RMSE = b_0 + b_1m_1 + b_2m_2$$`

where the `\(m_j\)` are indicator variables for the model (`glmnet`, MARS, etc).

However, there are usually resample-to-resample effects. To account for this, we can make this ANOVA model _specific to a resample_:


`$$RMSE_i = b_{i0} + b_{i1}m_1 + b_2m_{i2}$$`

where _i_ is the _i_&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; cross-validation fold. 

???
`m_1` = bagmars - glmnet, `m_2` = bagmars - mars, 


---

# Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Model &lt;img src="images/tidyposterior.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

We might assume that each 

`$$RMSE_{ij} \sim N(\beta_{i0} + \beta_{ij}m_{ij}, \sigma^2)$$` 

and that the `\(b\)` parameters have some multivariate normal distribution with mean `\(\beta\)` and some covariance matrix. The distribution of the `\(\beta\)` values, along with a distribution for the variance parameter, are the _prior distributions_. 

Bayesian analysis can be used to estimate these parameters. `tidyposterior` uses [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) to fit the model. 

There are options to change the assumed distribution of the metric (i.e. gamma instead of normality) or to transform the metric to normality. Different variances per model can also be estimated and the priors can be changed. 

???
A model-specific variance is more complex and more difficult to fit.

Surprisingly, the normal prior is very effective unless there is a ton of variation in the posterior (violates parameter bounds).

# Showing the Posterior Distributions &lt;img src="images/tidyposterior.png" class="title-hex"&gt;&lt;img src="images/ggplot2.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

Bayesian analysis can produce probability distributions for the estimated parameters (aka the _posterior distributions_).  These can be used to compare models.  



```r
posteriors &lt;- tidy(rmse_mod, seed = 366784)
summary(posteriors)
```

```
## # A tibble: 3 x 4
##   model   mean lower upper
##   &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 bagged  2.75  2.58  2.91
## 2 glmn    3.11  2.94  3.27
## 3 MARS    3.00  2.83  3.16
```

These are 90% _credible intervals_.

.pull-right[

```r
ggplot(posteriors)

Once the posteriors for each model are calculated, it is pretty easy to compute the posterior for the differences between models and plot them.


```r
differences &lt;-
  contrast_models(
    rmse_mod,
    list_1 = rep("bagged", 2),
    list_2 = c("glmn", "MARS"),
    seed = 2581
  )
```

If we know the size of a practical difference in RMSE values, this can be included into the analysis to get [ROPE estimates](http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/08/how-much-of-bayesian-posterior.html) (Region of Practical Equivalence).

.pull-right[

```r
ggplot(differences, size = 0.25)

# Comparing Models &lt;img src="images/tidyposterior.png" class="title-hex"&gt;

If we think that 0.25 MPG is a real difference, we can assess which models are practically different from one another. 



```r
summary(differences, size = 0.25)
```

```
## # A tibble: 2 x 9
##   contrast       probability   mean  lower  upper  size pract_neg pract_equiv pract_pos
##   &lt;chr&gt;                &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 bagged vs glmn    0        -0.358 -0.455 -0.258 0.250     0.964      0.0363         0
## 2 bagged vs MARS    0.000300 -0.249 -0.348 -0.150 0.250     0.495      0.505          0
```


`pract_neg` is the probability that the difference in RMSE is practically negative based on our thoughts about `size`.

Making predictions on new data is pretty simple:

.pull-left[

```r
car_test &lt;- car_test %&gt;%
  mutate(pred = predict(mars_gcv_bag, car_test))

rmse(car_test, truth = mpg, estimate = pred)
```

```
## [1] 2.63
```

```r
ggplot(car_test, aes(x = mpg, y = pred)) +
  geom_abline(col = "green", alpha = .5) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, col = "red", 
              lty = 2, lwd = 1, alpha = .5)
```

There are fewer new hybrid and electric models in the 2018 data.
